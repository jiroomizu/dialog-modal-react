# dialog-modal-react
HTML dialog element example with react.

## Does dialog tag make us implement modals easily?

`<dialog>` element is useful in some points like,

- browser default backdrops
- closing with Escape key
- automatically focus in form element when open the modaal

But is it practical?
So I tried it to compare with good old modal implementation.
